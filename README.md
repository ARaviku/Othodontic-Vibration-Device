# Othodontic-Vibration-Device

We aim to develop an inexpensive mouthpiece that accelerates tooth alignment for patients wearing braces. Low intensity vibrations have been shown to facilitate bone growth, which can be applied to teeth in order to help the alignment process. Our mouthpiece will feature the ability to measure and control these vibrations to enhance the efficacy of our product, which currently existing devices in the market are not capable of.
